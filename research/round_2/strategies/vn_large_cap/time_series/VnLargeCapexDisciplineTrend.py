"""
name:    VnLargeCapexDisciplineTrend
summary: Long large caps whose capital expenditure is fully funded by operating
         cash flow, with price above the 12/36 EMA trend.
idea:    Internal capex funding means a large cap invests without relying on new
         external debt or dilution, a sign of capital-allocation discipline. Only
         names whose annual CFO covers purchases of fixed assets are eligible; the
         12/36 EMA trend times the entry, and exit happens on negative cash
         generation, capex outrunning cash flow, or a trend break.
